					<p>
						I am a full stack developer based in Canada, everyday learning and
						conceptualizing new things to deliver beautiful and useful software
						solutions to people.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						I like to bring innovative ideas into action with my programming
						skills while making them beautiful for a better User Experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						I pursued my higher studies in Liberal Arts and Humanities, which
						later led me to an honours degree in IT and Management. This
						combination helped me amass a wealth of knowledge in computer
						science. So, I started my career as a Software Engineer back home.
						Upon arriving in Canada for my Masters, I temporarily steered away
						from my true passion, programming.
					</p>
					<p>
						But since nothing is fulfilling me as coding I wanted to return it.
						To refresh my skills and rekindle my enthusiasm, I attended a
						Software Engineering Bootcamp at Brainstation. This intensive,
						project-based program was a crucial step towards re-entering the
						career I'm most passionate about.
					</p>
					<p>
						{" "}
						It's been a challenging journey, but Iâ€™m committed to it and
						continue to code with determination.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm not just a programmer; I'm also an avid book lover, which I
						believe enhances my problem-solving abilities. Books encompass all
						kinds of problems, teaching me how to tackle challenges and find
						solutions. Besides, I love cats! They often play with my keyboard,
						causing syntax errors, but they also help throw away my stress with
						their 'purr' codes.
